# Railway Deployment Checklist

## ✅ Pre-Deployment

- [ ] Code pushed to GitHub
- [ ] `.env` file NOT committed (should be in `.gitignore`)
- [ ] `BOT_TOKEN` ready from @BotFather
- [ ] `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID` noted down
- [ ] Railway account created at [railway.app](https://railway.app)

## 📋 Deployment Steps

### 1. Create Railway Project
- [ ] Go to Railway dashboard
- [ ] Click "New Project"
- [ ] Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
- [ ] Choose your repository
- [ ] Wait for Railway to detect Dockerfile

### 2. Add PostgreSQL Database
- [ ] In project, click "New"
- [ ] Select "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
- [ ] Wait for database to provision
- [ ] `DATABASE_URL` is automatically configured

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Go to your service → "Variables" tab:

- [ ] Add `BOT_TOKEN` = `your_bot_token_from_botfather`
- [ ] Add `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID` = `your_telegram_id`
- [ ] Verify `DATABASE_URL` exists (auto-added)
- [ ] Verify `PORT` (optional, Railway sets automatically)

### 4. Deploy & Verify
- [ ] Wait for build to complete (3-5 minutes)
- [ ] Check "Deployments" tab for status
- [ ] View logs for any errors
- [ ] Test health endpoint: `https://your-app.railway.app/health`
- [ ] Test bot in Telegram

## 🔍 Post-Deployment Checks

- [ ] Bot responds to `/start` command
- [ ] Admin commands work
- [ ] Database migrations applied
- [ ] No errors in Railway logs
- [ ] Bot status is "Running" in Railway

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Build Failed?
```bash
# Check build logs in Railway dashboard
# Common issues:
# - Missing dependencies
# - Prisma migration errors
# - Memory limit exceeded
```

### Bot Not Responding?
- [ ] Check `BOT_TOKEN` is correct
- [ ] Verify `ADMIN_TELEGRAM_ID` is set
- [ ] View Railway logs for errors
- [ ] Ensure database is connected

### Database Connection Issues?
- [ ] Verify `DATABASE_URL` environment variable
- [ ] Check PostgreSQL service is running
- [ ] View connection logs in Railway
